# Pokemon Day Care Application 

### R1 - Description of Website

#### Purpose

Everyone knows the Pokemon daycare. Whether you were too lazy to farm exp, were trying to breed that perfect competitive mon, or just wanted to hatch a shiny - the daycare has always been there to help make that possible. 

Running a day care is hard work, however! Day cares are often run by older couples, and it can be easy to get lost amongst what is actually in the daycare at any given time, and who each Pokemon belongs to. It is also important for the Pokemon to be treated correctly, whether that be through training or being paired with the right partner.

Having this site will allow the daycare to properly manage the business, and ensure that their operations are held to a high standard.

Until now, daycare operations have been managed by other methods, that are harder to keep organised, such as a physical file system. Having an online booking system means that data is stored in the cloud, and can be accessible by multiple people, across multiple locations. 

The couple that runs this daycare is already quite happy with the idea of an online portal, as it is one less physical item that they have to worry about - everything is in the same place, and is easily accessible.

#### Features

This app can be used by both daycare owners and trainers:
